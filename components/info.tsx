          My main major at university is control and automation. But during my
          university studies, I had the opportunity to get acquainted with
          programming. And I started coding during my last years of college.
          After graduating, I began to learn about artificial intelligence and
          worked at a company in Vietnam for 1 year. At the same time, I learned
          more knowledge about DevOps and Web programming. Currently, I'm a
          DevOps Engineer at a company in Vietnam and I'm working on some
          personal projects.
